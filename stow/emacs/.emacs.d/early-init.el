;;; Commentary:

;;

;;; Code:

;; Package initialization happens before loading `user-init-file' but after
;; `early-init-file'. Since we handle package initialization explicitly
;; ourselves, we don't need Emacs to do it for us.
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Disable tool bar, scroll bar, and menu bar BEFORE the first frame is created.
;; Note: the menu bar can't actually be disabled on MacOS, so we check for that.
